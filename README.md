# Memory Card Game

## The objective of this game is to select one of each card displayed on the screen until you select them all without duplicates

## This React Project helped me better understand 

- Functional Components
- React Hooks such as useEffect and useState

## Things I will do to perfect this app

- Create a best score state that stores the best score in local storage
- Add the entire deck of cards
- Maybe add two jokers that are identical so people have to open developer tools to find the key of each jack and add more of a challenge
- Invoke shuffle function when the component mounts
